## Project Description

This project aims to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a Turtlebot3 Burger robot in the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework. It includes custom mapping, target recognition, and motion planning to navigate the robot to a specified target source.

### Implementing a custom mapping using a SLAM algorithm
SLAM algorithms are used to create maps of unknown environments while estimating the robot's pose within that environment. There are various SLAM algorithms available, such as EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, and GraphSLAM. Our aim is to create a custom SLAM package based on FastSLAM and integrate it with our robot.

### Navigating the Turtlebot to the target source by target recognition
To achieve this objective, We'll need to incorporate target recognition capabilities into our project. This involves computer vision techniques, such as object detection or image processing, to identify the target source. OpenCV is a popular library that provides computer vision functionalities and can be integrated with ROS. Once the target is recognized, using the robot's odometry and the map generated by SLAM to plan a path we can navigate the robot to the target destination.

### Creating motion planning for the robot using an algorithm
Motion planning involves generating a path or trajectory for the robot to follow while avoiding obstacles. There are several motion planning algorithms available, such as A*, RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees), or RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Star). These algorithms can be used to plan a collision-free path for the Turtlebot from its current position to the target position.
